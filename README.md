# This is the R code used in the study "Khan H., Marcé R., Laas A., Obrador B., "Pelagic calcite precipitation as a major component of the global carbon cycle in lakes and reservoirs"
# The code was used for assessing the effect of calcite precipitation on pCO2. The outputs of this model were then used with the global distribution of lakes per alkalinity level (data from Marcé et al., 2015) for upscaling at a global level the CO2 emitted by calcification.
# The model is based on the carbonate equilibra using the AquaEnv package.
